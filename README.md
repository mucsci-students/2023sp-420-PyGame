## How to Play:

Create words using letters from the hive and try to get the maximum score. Words must have at least four letters and include the required letter (The letter in the center of the hive). The required letter is surrounded by six letters that you use additionally (not required). Use the six additional letters along with the required letter to create words. Using letters that are not given will result in a wrong answer. Every letter can be used more than one time in a single guess. Word guesses can not contain hyphens, proper nouns, vulgarities, or obscure words. Each puzzle includes at least one “pangram” which uses all seven given letters at least once.
