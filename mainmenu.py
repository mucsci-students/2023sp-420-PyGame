Instructions

Create words using letters from the hive and try to get the maximum score. 
Words must have at least four letters and include the center letter in brackets. 
Letters can be used more than once. 
Words with hyphens, proper nouns, vulgarities, and especially obscure words are not in the word list. 
Score points to increase your rating. 
4-letter words are worth 1 point each.
Longer words earn 1 point per letter. 
Each puzzle includes at least one ‚Äúpangram‚Äù which uses every letter. 
These are worth 7 extra points!
